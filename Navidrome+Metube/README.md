This is a little project with the open-source software Navidrome and Metube combined together, along with Authelia for authentication,
it provides a Web UI to download your favoruite music into the music server.

Once these two containers are running, I would deploy Authelia.
Authelia is an open-source authentication and authorization server 
It provides the identity and access management (IAM) role of information security in providing multi-factor authentication and single sign-on (SSO) for your applications via a web portal.
The reason I use Authelia is to prevent unauthorized user to access the WEB UI and downlaod random songs to my music server.
