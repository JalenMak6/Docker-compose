TLDR:

The Alertmanager handles alerts sent by client applications such as the Prometheus server. It takes care of deduplicating, grouping, and routing them to the correct receiver integration such as email, PagerDuty, or OpsGenie. It also takes care of silencing and inhibition of alerts.

Deploying Alertmanager container can send alert to my slack channel :)

I can provision my virtual machine based on different criteria
